This is a repository for generative art projects that I do.
Generative Art:  Art that was made entirely or partially using an autonomous system, generative art may take different forms, including music and visual arts.  Any algorithm, whether mathematical, mechanical can describe this system. Source: https://magazine.artland.com/generative-art/
